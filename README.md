# AI for Medicine

## [AI for Medical Diagnosis](/AI%20for%20Medical%20Diagnosis)

AI for Medical Diagnosis includes 3 main assignments.
1. In [first assignment](./AI%20for%20Medical%20Diagnosis/C1_W1_Assignment.ipynb), I have explored medical image diagnosis by building a state-of-the-art chest X-ray classifier using Keras and Tensorflow.
2. In [second assignment](./AI%20for%20Medical%20Diagnosis/C1_W2_Assignment.ipynb), I have worked with the results of the X-ray classification model I developed in the previous assignment. In order to make the data processing a bit more manageable, I have worked with a subset of our training, and validation datasets. I have also used our manually labeled test dataset of 420 X-rays.
3. In [third assignment](./AI%20for%20Medical%20Diagnosis/C1_W3_Assignment.ipynb), I have learnt how to build a neural network to automatically segment tumor regions in brain, using MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) scans.

## [AI for Prognosis](./AI%20for%20Prognosis)

AI for Prognosis includes 4 assignments.
1. In [first assignment](./AI%20for%20Prognosis/C2_W1_Assignment.ipynb), I have build a risk score model for retinopathy in diabetes patients using logistic regression.
2. In [second assignment](./AI%20for%20Prognosis/C2_W2_Assignment.ipynb), I have gained experience with tree based models by predicting the 10-year risk of death of individuals from the NHANES I epidemiology dataset.
3. In [third assignment](./AI%20for%20Prognosis/C2_W3_Assignment.ipynb), I have used Python to build some of the statistical models to analyze surivival estimates for a dataset of lymphoma patients.
4. In [fourth assignment](./AI%20for%20Prognosis/C2_W4_Assignment.ipynb), I have developed risk models using survival data and a combination of linear and non-linear techniques. I have used a dataset with survival data of patients with Primary Biliary Cirrhosis (pbc).

## [AI for Medical Treatment](./AI%20for%20Medical%20Treatment)

AI for Medical Treatment includes 3 assignments.
1. In [first assignment](./AI%20for%20Medical%20Treatment/Week%201/C3_W1_Assignment.ipynb), I have used different methods to evaluate the results of a randomized control trial (RCT).
2.  In [second assignment](./AI%20for%20Medical%20Treatment/Week%202/C3_W2_Assignment.ipynb), I have learnt to extract information from unstructured medical text.This assignment is inspired by the work done by Irvin et al.
3.  In [third assignment](./AI%20for%20Medical%20Treatment/Week%203/C3_W3_Assignment.ipynb), I have focused on the interpretation of machine learning and deep learning models.
