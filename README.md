# AI for Medicine

## [AI for Medical Diagnosis](/AI%20for%20Medical%20Diagnosis)

AI for Medical Diagnosis includes 3 main assignments.
1. In [first assignment](./AI%20for%20Medical%20Diagnosis/C1_W1_Assignment.ipynb), I have explored medical image diagnosis by building a state-of-the-art chest X-ray classifier using Keras and Tensorflow.

## [AI for Prognosis](./AI%20for%20Prognosis)

AI for Prognosis includes 4 assignments.
1. In [first assignment](./AI%20for%20Prognosis/C2_W1_Assignment.ipynb), I have build a risk score model for retinopathy in diabetes patients using logistic regression.
2. In [second assignment](./AI%20for%20Prognosis/C2_W2_Assignment.ipynb), I have gained experience with tree based models by predicting the 10-year risk of death of individuals from the NHANES I epidemiology dataset.
3. In [third assignment](./AI%20for%20Prognosis/C2_W3_Assignment.ipynb), I have used Python to build some of the statistical models to analyze surivival estimates for a dataset of lymphoma patients.
4. In [fourth assignment](./AI%20for%20Prognosis/C2_W4_Assignment.ipynb), I have developed risk models using survival data and a combination of linear and non-linear techniques. I have used a dataset with survival data of patients with Primary Biliary Cirrhosis (pbc).
